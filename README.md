# sublime2matlab
Run m-file in Matlab from Sublime using any desired key combination.

#How does it work?
It is a script written in AutoHotkey lenguage (open source), that runs in the background and when set key combination is detected, it gets path of the m-file opened in Sublime Text and opens it in Matlab and "press" F5 to run it.


#How to use it?
You will need to install AutoHotkey (http://www.autohotkey.com/) , and the script from this repository running in background (I put it in startup folder).
